## Description
This project is a functioning weather dashboard. It utilizes the OpenWeather API to display a variety of data about both the current weather and future forecasting. When a search is submitted, it is also logged to the search history, where a button is generated that will render the information from past searches when clicked. Search history is saved in local storage, but can be cleared at any time with the 'Clear Search History' button.
